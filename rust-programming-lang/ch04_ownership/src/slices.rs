    // Rust disallows the mutable reference in clear and the immutable reference in word
    // from existing at the same time
    println!("{word}"); // hello

    // String Literals as Slices
    // The type of s here is &str: itâ€™s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary.
    // This is also why string literals are immutable; &str is an immutable reference.

    // s = "can not change the variable (immutable reference)"

    // A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in prev
    // first_word func as the following instead,  because it allows us to use
    // the same function on both &String values and &str values:
    // fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
