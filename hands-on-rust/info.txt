Making Clippy Pedantic
  If you don’t feel that Clippy is complaining enough, you can configure Clippy
  to be even more strict in its analysis. As the first line of your main.rs file, add:
  
  #![warn(clippy::all, clippy::pedantic)]


# cargo search bracket-terminal
  search the crates (packages ) registry 

• =0.8.0 will only use version 0.8.0 - nothing lower or higher.

• ^0.8.0 will use any version equal to or greater than 0.8.0, but only within the 0.x version range.

• ~0.8.0 will use any minor version greater than 0.8.0 . Updates will automat-
  ically be applied, even if they break the crate’s API.

A few different options are available; you can specify a version to download
  from crates.io, a Git repository address, or even a local path for a crate stored
  on your computer.16 For example, if you wanted to use the GitHub version of
  bracket-lib, you could specify it as follows:
[dependencies]
bracket-lib = { git = "https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib" }

Crates can also provide feature flags. This allows a crate to offer optional
  functionality. For example, bracket-lib can be configured to use Amethyst as its
  back end, rather than OpenGL. You would specify this as follows:

[dependencies]
bracket-lib = {
git = "https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib",
  default-features = false,
  features = [ "amethyst_engine_vulkan" ]
}
